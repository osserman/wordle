            <h2>Word Winnowing</h2>
            <p>You know that feeling in Wordle? When it goes from "it could be anything!" to "I can't think of anything it could be!" I was curious to see how that happens.</p>
            <p id='description'>Here's a game of Wordle that was randomly generated when you opened this page. The answer and all the guesses were selected from a set of English words around as common as actual Wordle answers.</p>
            <p>As you go through the game the number of possible answers remaining is shown by the size of the <span class='green'>green</span> circle, and the number of words you've elimated is shown by the <span class='orange'>orange</span> area around the green circle (only visible once you click the button below to get started). </p>

            <summary>Word selection process</summary>
            <p>In these games, each guess is chosen randomly from all the possible remaining words that meet the criteria already learned (i.e. letters excluded, letters included and letter position/non-position).</p>
            <p>I'm not saying this is the optimal approach to playing Wordle, but an interesting one to look at none the less.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>A note on the set of words being considered</summary>
            <p>There are three different sets of words I considered using. </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Wordle's <strong>actual</strong> answers. This is the set of 2315 words that Wordle selects their answers from.</li>
                <li><strong>Common</strong> 5-letter English words. These are the 4561 most common 5-letter words from the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/wordfreq/" target="_blank">WordFreq</a> dataset that are also considered valid entries by Wordle. The cutoff of 4561 words was choosen because it's the number of words which includes 95% of the Wordle's actual answers. Beyond that words get pretty obscure.</li>
                <li><strong>All</strong> Wordle words. This set includes all 12972 5-letter words that Wordle accepts as a guess, most of which are really quite obscure.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This page defaults to "Common" words, because using Wordle's actual answers is kind of cheating, and because using all 13K 5-letter words includes a bunch of words that only scrabble fanatics know about. </p>
